			<br />2:36pm March 12th, 2008</h6>
			<p>If you are trying to get Ruby to run on Cygwin and you have a dual installation 
			with the click-once Windows ruby install, make sure your RubyOpt environment variable 
			is cleared.  Alternatively you can unset it like so:</p>
			<p>> unset RubyOpt</p>
			<p>from within Cygwin.  Undoubtedly the first thing you are going to do once you get 
			Ruby installed is to get RubyGems working.  Some gems would install and work fine and 
			some would fail miserably.  Strange errors happened when the Gem was trying to be 
			compiled for my machine.  I 
			couldn't figure out what was wrong and Google was no help.  Eventually, I figured 
			out that nothing was compiling properly because make was failing.  So I checked my 
			install of Cygwin, and lo and behold make, nor gcc were installed.  That'll stop 
			compiling dead in its tracks, huh?!</p>
			<p>I just went through the Cygwin install again and made sure I selected those packages
			from the Devel section.  After that everything worked.  I'm putting this up so that 
			nobody else has this problem.  </p>			
			
			<h6><a name="arc">Arc by Paul Graham</a>
			<br />10:55am January 30th, 2008</h6>
			<p>This might be the most important development in the Lisp community in some time: 
			Paul Graham has released onto the world his version of Lisp, called Arc.  
			<a href="http://arclanguage.org/install">[Click here to download it]</a>
			The main differences are some tricks and alterations that PG found useful and the making 
			of specific decisions to make the language a "good medium for exploratory programming".</p>
			<p>I am extremely excited about this language because it seems to have generated some pretty 
			extensive buzz.  <a href="http://arclanguage.org/newest">[Click here for Forums on Arc]</a>
			I am hopeful that a nice community will grow around this language.  I personally will be 
			contributing something, though I am not sure what yet.  I believe that Paul Graham has 
			enough of an interested following that this language could become something special.  
			</p>
			<p>In short, check out Arc. </p>

			<br />1:12am January 17th, 2008</h6>
			<p>I have no firm numbers to support it, but I think that there are 10 times as many jobs for web programming 
			on Guru.com as there are Windows programming jobs.  What I didn't know before trying to get into that market 
			was that those jobs also paid about 5 times as much and were about half as hard.  
			</p>			
			<p>Take a tip from the guy who wanted way too long; switch to where the market is most profitable.  Do so even 
			if it makes you feel dirty because you are no longer really programming, you are merely web programming.  Get 
			over that feeling by writing your own web framework or at least working in a language that you want to work in 
			(like:  Arc {<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=98297">coming soon!</a>}, Python, Ruby).

			<H6><a name="Ubuntu-over-windows">Ubuntu over Windows</a>
			<br />12:52am January 17th, 2008</h6>
			<p>I bought parts to build a new computer.  I needed an operating system.  I do mostly C# .NET programming 
			but I am moving towards web programming using more open source technology (Ruby on Rails).  I have 
			Windows XP on my old machine and it has served me well, but I don't want to have to buy another copy of it.  
			I sure as hell am not putting Windows Vista on it.  That leaves me with few options.  I dig around my 
			book shelf and find a book entitled "Ubuntu Hacks" which I bought about a year ago.  I flip through it.  
			I confirm that I can get my dual monitor setup working.  I remember installed Redhat Linux in 1999 and 
			having to deal with a lot of winmodem issues, but I double check and it's not 1999 and I am blessed with 
			ethernet.  [Side note: it's so sad I had dial-up then.]  Now, I am starting to like the idea of putting Linux 
			once again on my computer, and not dual boot this time, I mean the full switch over.
			</p>
			<p>I burn my Ubuntu install CD.  I put my computer together, even substituting an 8 year old CDRW for the DVD 
			burner that hasn't arrived yet.  I put the CD in.  I get to test drive Linux.  It's easy and the video drivers 
			work without me even doing anything.  HMMM..can't be that easy, how come Microsoft is still in business?  I 
			install Ubuntu.  I do nothing at all and it does all the work for me.
			</p>
			<p>I have Ubuntu installed and it's working great.  I get all the updates that it automatically notifies me of. 
			I get the update for the nvidia card I have (properietary Ubuntu warns me) and I change the config file so 
			that it maps across my two monitors using the hardware in the card, the OS has no idea.  I get the 2nd hard drive 
			mounted.  All in all, installation takes me maybe an hour.  Everything just works.  I start checking out the programs 
			available on Ubuntu.  It has everything I need.  The only thing missing is Ruby and Rails.
			</p>
			<p>With modest effort I get those on the machine and working.  "apt-get" is the greatest thing ever.  I'm off to 
			the train yard doing Rails development.  
			</p>
			<p>How is Microsoft not losing market share to Linux?  There are companies that support Linux, so you can't make 
			the "I need support" argument and anyway when was the last time you called Microsoft for support?  If my mom can 
			use a max with OS X (a.k.a. secret Unix that works with modern hardware) on it then I am certain that most normal 
			people could use Ubuntu Linux.  
			</p>
			<p>I was going to do a whole series of articles on my transition to Linux and how it was coming along.  Too bad for 
			me that Linux is so easy to use.  Seriously, I love the shell.  There is nothing more joyful than being able to make 
			things easier for yourself by writing simple scripts.  Screw DOS prompts.

			<h6><a name="divergent-language-design">Divergent Language Design: Single Author vs. Groups</a>
			<br />7:01am December 18th, 2007</h6>
			<p>As I read <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/28422d707512283">this article</a> concerning 
			the difference (or lack thereof) between Ruby and Python it occurred to me that there might be two types of programming 
			languages, or at least there ought to be two types.  Usually languages are viewed on a continuum from worst to best or 
			most powerful to least powerful.  These continuum are highly subjective, focusing on the type of programming that 
			the creator of the list is often engaged in.  Alex Martelli in the article says:				
			</p>
			<p>"For the purposes of meta programming, implementing
			experimental frameworks, and the like, this amazing dynamic
			ability of Ruby is _extremely_ appealing.  BUT -- if we're
			talking about large applications, developed by many people
			and maintained by even more, including all kinds of libraries
			from diverse sources, and needing to go into production in
			client sites... well, I don't WANT a language that is QUITE
			so dynamic, thank you very much.  "</p>
			<p>This is probably the most important and telling example of the dichotomy that I believe exists in language design.  
			Some languages are designed for a single programming to be productive and some are designed to allow for a team of 
			people to be able to collaborate.  Alex Martelli is effectively saying that if someone else is going to work on his project 
			then he doesn't want them to be able to alter the basic assumptions it is built upon.  It is even pointed out that 
			for meta programming and experimental frameworks it is often a positive to have this much control.  The implied caveat 
			here is that most of those experimental activities are undertaken by someone working on something they are interested 
			in, on their own time, alone.  </p>			
			<p>This is also evidenced by the divide between strong typing and weak typing.  The strong type advocates 
			want the guarantee that nobody else is going to hose up their code, at least not by calling it with the wrong type 
			of arguments.  This situation is ideal for a programming language that is being used over an entire organization 
			in order to produce a large code base with many facets.  On the other hand, if you are the only person using the code 
			you are writing then you don't really need to make sure that the unknowing programmer 3 cubicle rows over isn't going to call your 
			function with inappropriate arguments.  The whole purpose of "bondage" programming is to keep other people from 
			messing up your code.  If nobody else is messing with your code, then you can gladly make the changes that you want.</p>
			<p>Is it any wonder that the more "powerful" and "dynamic" languages allow for changes to the language themselves, or 
			at the very least have some facility for the production of domain specific languages?  The more flexible the language 
			the more danger there is with collaboration because of the possible overlap of effects (for example the dynamic changing of 
			base classes, like the string class).  Domain specific languages by definition are making a new language on top of the 
			implementation language, thus extending the possibility that not everyone would be on the same page.  </p>
			<p>To combat the endless mixed comparisons between languages we should make (at least) two categories of programming 
			languages, starting by separating those intended for team collaboration from those that are intended for the super 
			programmer to accomplish something in a short period of time.  I don't think we should even be arguing whether Java or 
			Lisp or Ruby or C# or C++ or [insert your favorite language here] is more or less powerful until we have at least 
			defined some of the parameters of the discussion.  Some languages are clearly meant for collaborative, distributed work.  
			Others have features which are powerful and that power makes them less suited to large group collaborative projects.</p>
			<p>If we as a profession are really interested in making progress we need to start looking at languages in the way that 
			we use them instead of the way they are normally differentiated (static vs. dynamic typing, functional vs. object orientated, 
			on and on forever).  There are two, maybe 3 ways that programming languages are used.  The first is the lone programmer.  
			The second is the small group of lone programmers.  Finally, there are the collaborative groups that produce 
			larger scale software.  
			Each clearly has different needs from their programming language, with the possibility that the second group is small enough 
			that they can pretend they are a single programmer because they either communicate so well, or are so adept at 
			programming that it overcomes any possible drawbacks of using the more powerful, but less collaborative language.  Frankly, 
			I'm not sure there is a lot of difference between 1 great programmer and 3 great programmers working together.  Once you 
			get away from great programmers, and start moving towards normal programmers you not only increase the communication barrier 
			but you drastically reduce the individual programmer's ability.  
			</p>
			<p>Long story short, we should investigate whether we as a profession are oversimplifying our categorization of programming 
			languages so that they are forced onto a single continuum.  Why can't we use one language in the case where we are 
			working alone, and one in the case where we have to work with 300 other programmers?  Is it so wrong to suggest that 
			maybe a different solution is needed for different problems?

			<h6><a name="Releasing-Early-and-Often-is-Hard">Releasing Early and Often is Hard</a><br />10:01am August 17th, 2007</h6>
			<p>Everyone says release early and often.  Everybody says it results in a better product, and more energized users.  
			Everybody says that getting it in front of your customers is like super-mega-dog-fooding.  I tend to agree with 
			everyone.  It's common knowledge and common sense for a reason.  
			</p>
			<p>Here's the problem:  nobody says how to do it best.  Nobody is out there talking to you about how you handle 
			developing new features along with fixing bugs in your "current" release.  The new features delay bug fixes because 
			you only have one code base, and you're only one person.  Nobody says be ready for a deluge of bug reports and 
			new features requests.  Nobody warns you how obvious those requests are and how they make you feel foolish.  Worse yet 
			sometimes you realize your entire approach is flawed and requires a redesign (see <a href="rewriting-is-good">rewriting is good</a>).			
			</p>
			<p>How come nobody talks about this?  How come nobody is out there talking about a system to integrate your bug tracking, 
			feature additions and enhancements and coordinating that with your version control system, your nightly build system and 
			your deployment system?  Remember, you're only one person.  Wouldn't it be nice if there wasn't so much duplicated work 
			for things that are obviously best practice (version control, custom build systems, unit testing, product keys, product key deliver, 
			payment acceptance, automated product updates, content management for your website, etc.).  All these things exist.  All 
			of them are pretty well understood.  All of them are pretty much accepted as best practice.  So how come I'm having to 
			make all of them myself, or worse, buy someone else's and then integrate them together myself?
			</p>
			<p>Is that opportunity I smell?
			</p>
			
			<h6><a name="rewriting-is-good">Programmer's Note: Rewriting is Natural</a><br />12:40am August 17th, 2007</h6>
			<p>You are going to have to rewrite code.  You are going to have to redesign portions of your code.  Something unexpected 
			is going to happen.  Get used to it.  Plan for it.  If this is your first time writing this software, plan to write it again.  
			Your first attempt isn't good enough for commercial software (in general) unless your problem is extremely easy, which 
			means you already have lots of competition and you aren't going to want to make this software anyway.  Deal with it. </p>
			<p>Common sources of having to rewrite a section of your code:  <br />(1) changing requirements (aka "Oh, yeah, and it has to 
			read and write email and have a calendar") <br />(2) performance issues (aka "Of course it's slow when you open a file that is larger than 
			the RAM you have available on your machine") <br />(3) 
			space issues (aka "what do you mean it doesn't fit on a CD?") <br />(4) 3rd party product changes (aka "what do you mean our 
			PDF plugin doesn't support graphs?") </p>
			<p>I'm just saying ... be prepared.

			<p>After reading an excellent productivity <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/life_hacks/index.html">blog post </a>by Marc Andreessen
				<a href="img\pmarca_productivity_app.jpg">
				<img src="img\pmarca_productivity_app_small.jpg" style="Float:left;border: none;margin:5px;"/></a> I mocked up an application that would allow me 
				to implement his version of the 3 list scheme (ToDo, Watch, Later).  I referred to them in the software as Active, Waiting 
				and Archived respectively.  Following good mISV tendencies, I made the absolute minimum product that would do the job for me.  
				My version includes the ability to attach and view notes to each project or activity in any of the lists.  				 
			</p>
			<p>This is by no means break through software, but I have to tell you that it has made keeping track of my various projects 
			and activities much easier.  I also cannot express the sense of excitement (relief?) I feel when I put a task or project into 
			the Archived list.  In my mind, that means it is gone forever.</p>

			<p>It has come to my attention that I made a mistake of "flavor" in my previous post entitled 
			<a href="#Fun-with-Python-Metaprogramming">Simple Python Metaprogramming</a>.  Apparently, it is 
			not recommended for someone to access the __dict__ attribute directly, and instead there are a pair of 
			methods normally used for this operation (setattr and getattr).  I have, therefore, rewritten the 
			previous examples using those methods.

			<p>So the other day I was trying not to type a bunch of code, and in my laziness I found out

			</p>
			<p>I like this technique because it can be used to store the contents of your object to a file for later use.  In order 
			to use them later though, you have to have a way to read it back into an object.  Effectively an inverse function 
			of the __str__ function.  Again being lazy, I used metaprogramming:</p>
			<p class=code>
			def&nbsp;read(s):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""&nbsp;s&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;string&nbsp;created&nbsp;with&nbsp;__str__.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns&nbsp;a&nbsp;game&nbsp;with&nbsp;attributes&nbsp;set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g&nbsp;=&nbsp;game()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;line&nbsp;in&nbsp;s.splitlines():<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(attr,&nbsp;val)&nbsp;=&nbsp;line.split('&nbsp;:&nbsp;')<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;g.__dict__[attr].__class__&nbsp;==&nbsp;[].__class__:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.__dict__[attr].append(val)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.__dict__[attr]&nbsp;=&nbsp;val<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;g<br>
			</p>
			<p>I'm not suggesting using this on a large scale basis.  I'm somewhat new to Python, but I believe there is a 
			process called pickling that can be used for this same purpose.  It performs object serialization, where I am 
			merely putting together a simple string representation of my object.  Pickling is undoubtedly better for 
			larger objects, or objects that cannot be represented easily as a string or other basic type.  I do think 
			this example is valuable because if you later have to add another attribute you can do so without have to 
			alter the __str__ or read methods.
			</p>
			<p>Metaprogramming seems to me to be a way of taking advantage of information that is inherent in your code 
			but that you may not have previously thought of as "program" information.  The names of classes, variables, 
			methods, and other inherent program information (like inheritence trees and interfaces) are all useful 
			metadata when you have the opportunity to use them.  That is to say nothing of the ability to change objects 
			on the fly, create custom role specific objects (called "Singletons" in Ruby, not to be confused with the 
			anti-pattern singleton global reference) and the variety of other tools that metaprogramming facilities 
			provide.
			</p>			
			<p>I often try to explain to other 
			people why metaprogramming is useful, and it's hard to come up with a reasonable, concrete example so that 
			others can see what you are talking about.  My purpose in this article was to show an example that I've 
			used, allowing others to see the example.  I admit it is not that complex and it's not groundbreaking 
			in any way, but I think it is a good example for someone who has no experience in metaprogramming or 
			its possible benefits.

			<h6><a name="random-csharp-idea">Random C# Idea</a><br>3:41 March 7th, 2007</h6>
			<p>I was sitting at my computer the other day, pondering what could be done to improve the ease of 
			use for C#.  I was mostly annoyed that it didn't have multiple returns, or even some way to group 
			a couple of items together and easily get back the values in a calling method.  I was also thinking 
			about anonymous methods and how fun they are.  Those two ideas crashed together to make something 
			new that I am calling anonymous types.  It's similar to duck typing, but I think it could be 
			easily implemented in C# via a pre-compilation macro expansion.  Here's some code (please forgive the word wrapping):</p>
			<p class="code">
			<span class="keyword">public </span><span class="keyword">object </span>GetMyValues(){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">return </span><span class="keyword">new anonymous object</span>(<span class="keyword">int </span>firstVal, <span class="keyword">int </span>secondVal){ firstVal = 10; secondVal = 5};<br>
}<br>	
<br>
<span class="keyword">public </span><span class="keyword">void </span>UsageOfAnonymousObject(){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">object </span>anon = GetMyValues();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;MessageBox.Show(String.Format("{0} : {1}", anon.firstVal, anon.secondVal));<br>}
			</p>
			<p>I threw a new keyword in there, anonymous.  The idea being that it marks that object as an anonymous object, but that should be 
			expanded by the compiler before compiling the code.  The stuff after the object is effectively the constructor to that object along 
			with some initialization.  That gives the compiler enough information to rewrite the code to something like:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
			<span class="keyword">public </span><span class="keyword">class </span>AnonymousObject{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">private </span><span class="keyword">int </span>_firstVal;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">public </span><span class="keyword">int </span>firstVal {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">get{</span>	 <span class="keyword">return </span><span class="keyword">this</span>._firstval;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">set{</span>	 <span class="keyword">this</span>._firstVal = value; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">private </span><span class="keyword">int </span>_secondVal;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">public </span><span class="keyword">int </span>secondVal {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">get{</span>	 <span class="keyword">return </span><span class="keyword">this</span>._secondVal;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">set{</span>	 <span class="keyword">this</span>._secondVal = value; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">public </span>AnonymousObject(<span class="keyword">int </span>firstval, <span class="keyword">int </span>secondval){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_firstVal = firstval;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_secondVal = secondval;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">public </span><span class="keyword">object </span>GetMyValues(){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">return </span><span class="keyword">new </span>AnonymousObject(10, 5);<br>
}<br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">public </span><span class="keyword">void </span>UsageOfAnonymousObject(){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;AnonymousObject anon = GetMyValues();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;MessageBox.Show(String.Format("{0} : {1}", anon.firstVal, anon.secondVal));<br>
}
			</p>
			<p>
			Why is this useful?  Well, I'm lazy, so I don't like to type more than I have to when I could instead invent a 
			new construct that will take care of the busy work of typing out an object to hold two values that'll never 
			be used again.  I think this would eliminate a lot of cruft that exists to move data around because of the 
			limitations of C# v2.0.  
			</p>
			<p>Postscript:  I have no idea if this kind of thing has existed somewhere else before.  I am sure that 
			I am borrowing concepts (macro expansions, anonymous methods) from existing programming languages.  If this 
			is in C# v3.0 and I just don't know about it, all the better for me.

			<a name="reduce"><h6>Fun with reduce in Python and Boo<br>9:09pm Feb 7th, 2007</h6></a>
			<p>The other day I was trying to work out a very complex calculation, and it seemed naturally suited 
			to a functional approach using closures.  So, I break out my DrScheme editor and I go to work.  Happily, 
			I type away, knowing that I am going to have to translate some or most of what I am writing to either 
			Python or Boo.  I know this because the project that uses this calculation has several different parts 
			made up of one of those languages, and I would rather not introduce yet another language into the mix.			
			</p>
			<p>[Side Note:  Boo is excellent language if you are making Windows Forms programs and want to use something 
			similar to Python.  It is excellent at letting you bang out a quick prototype and appears to be relatively 
			stable.  The only thing about the language that falls a little short for me is the type inference.  Once 
			they get that working a little better, I will likely start doing an increasing amount of "we don't care what 
			language it's done in" consulting projects using Boo.  Check out <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org">Boo</a>]
			</p>
			<p>As I am writing my Scheme, I notice that reduce is going to be central to making the code succinct.  I 
			decide that I need to make sure that reduce is available in Python and Boo, thinking that it will surely be there 
			and it won't be a worry.  Turns out that Boo is missing reduce altogether and Python makes it interesting 
			because of the weak lambda functionality.
			</p>
			<p>First, some Boo: </p>
			<p class="code">
			def reduce(f as callable, lst as List, init):	<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for item in lst: <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;init = f(init, item)<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return init<br>
			</p>
			<p>This version of reduce takes a function ("callable"), a List, and an initialization.  I could default the 
			initialization, but I didn't need it for this particular implementation.  I should also note that this 
			function might have to be rewritten (or more generally written) with IEnumerable in place of the List.  
			I would also caution that this version when using an object as the init will change state on that object 
			if the callable has side effects.  For my purposes, this was okay because I was working with pass by value init 
			values.  You will also notice that the method body is almost entirely devoid of types.  It does require that 
			the callable takes two arguments, but that is to be expected.  This leads to the maximum amount of flexibility 
			when using the function.  You can use this reduce function as follows: 
			</p>
			<p class="code">
			reduce({x as int ,y as int| return x*y}, [1,2,3,4,5], 1)
			</p>
			<p>You will notice that you must stipulate the types of the two arguments in the anonymous function.  If you don't 
			Boo will assume they are objects and act accordingly, which will cause the above example to fail.  I figure it 
			a small consolation to have to stipulate the types in the anonymous function if I don't have to rewrite reduce 
			for a bunch of different types.  Note that you can write multiline anonymous functions in Boo (examples: 
			<a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/Closures">here</a>).
			</p>
			<p>Python fairs better in that it provides a reduce function out of the box.  However, in contrast to Boo 
			Python does not allow for multiline anonymous functions.  This problem is mitigated by the fact that you can 
			simply define another function internal to the function are currently in.  Here's a lambda example for Python:
			</p>
			<p class="code">reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, [1,2,3,4,5])</p>
			<p>This code works pefectly well, as intended.  However, due to the limitations of lambda, this code fails:</p>
			<p class="code">reduce(lambda x,y: return x+y, [1,2,3,4,5])</p>
			<p>Okay, no problem, but what if I want to use a named function instead of a lambda.  I write the named function 
			and then I call it in the lambda as below:</p>
			<p class="code">
			def sum(x,y):<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x + y<br>
			<br>
			reduce(sum, [1,2,3,4,5])
			</p>
			<p>I was mildly surprised to find that this didn't work, since I thought I had substituted a reasonable named 
			function.  However, it occured to me that lambda is very different from a named function, so I had better put 
			in the return as follows:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
			def sum(x,y):<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return x + y<br>
			<br>
			reduce(sum, [1,2,3,4,5])
			</p>
			<p>This appears to work fine and is another reminder to me to be careful when I am trying to use lambda in Python.
			</p>
			<p>Based on this experiment, it is likely that I am going to use Python to do the calculations because it has built 
			in reduce and I can easily use internal function definitions to take the place of multiline lambdas.  Once I make 
			the conversion I might have to post the results of some key areas with examples in both Python and Scheme.
			</p>
			<p>As a side note, it is somewhat startling to me how easy this is to do in Scheme, and how difficult it is to do 
			in other languages.  I am not sure if the problem I am working on is just particularly suited to functional programming 
			or if I am stuck in thinking about it from a Scheme perspective, and just trying to translate that to another language.  
			There might be something to this theory that learning alternative programming languages changes the way you 
			<strong>are able</strong> to think about problems.

			<h6><a name="consulting-to-shrinkwrapped-software">Why Consulting is a Good Way to Start a Shrinkwrapped Software Company</a>
				<br>7:30am Feb 1st, 2007</h6>
			<p>Consulting is a good way to start a shrinkwrapped software company.  It is particularly good if you 
			are unsure what market you want to enter with your shrinkwrapped product.  Products are born out of the 
			needs of your customers.  Consulting is a good way to start because it gives you the flexibility to work 
			with a lot of different customers in a lot of different industries.  It also has the nice side effect of 
			paying the bills while you get your product developed.  If you simply must start your microISV today, 
			consulting is a good way to start because of the instant income.  
			</p>
			<p>I am not alone in believing that you can 
			grow a shrinkwrapped product out of a consulting company.  Joel Spolsky discusses his 
			journey through consulting to his product <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/joelspolsky.html">here</a>. 
			In Joel's case, consulting was a means to an end.  The end came sooner than he had expected because of the 
			dotcom bust.  The consulting work dried up with the downturn.  He was forced into releasing his product 
			sooner than he had anticipated.  In truth, it seems the product his company is most famous for (FogBugz) 
			is not even really the product that he wanted to make.  He just happened to have it ready to go when 
			people were asking for it.  Consulting gave him the time to build up his product (even though at the time 
			he didn't realize it would be his biggest product) without having to risk nearly as much.
			</p>
			<p>This core idea, which Joel ascribes to ArsDigita, is now central to the birth of several microISVs.  It 
			provides a lower risk alternative to experienced programmers than simply quitting their job and writing a 
			product.  The consulting revenue is easy enough to live on while you are sharpening your product.  But the 
			real benefit of consulting while you are making shrinkwrapped software is that you get to experience the 
			pain of several types of customers in several types of industries.  This allows you a broader view of 
			what customer's needs are, even across industries than you could garner working as an employee.  
			</p>
			<p>Volz Software is following this path.  Consulting revenue is what pays for my life while I develop 
			shrinkwrapped products (like <a href="http://www.llamacarboncopy.com">Llama Carbon Copy</a>).  I find 
			that I am identifying similar points of strain in businesses as diverse as mortgage processing and health 
			care.  These points of strain are opportunities.  Finding them is like finding little nuggets of gold in 
			a stream in 1849 California.  The difference is that a single nugget, properly polished can yield an entire 
			bank full of money.  
			</p>
			
			<h6>A Small Tip for Guru.com<br>8:30pm Jan 31st, 2007</h6>
			<p>Try to avoid any jobs that in their listing use any of the following phrases or their isomorphs:
			</p>
			<div style="padding-left:2em;">
			<p>"Very simple program to write"</p>
			<p>"I've seen the code online"</p>
			<p>"Very easy and quick project"</p>
			<p>"I need a small program to..."</p>
			</div>
			<p>Always be cautious with this kind of job because the employee has already devalued the job in their 
			own mind.  Particularly be careful with jobs that have one or more of these indicators, and a maximum bid amount 
			of $250 or less.
			</p>
			<p>This rule is by no means universal, but it has kept me from bidding on some obvioulsy time consuming projects 
			that are only going to yield a very small amount of money, particularly when I calculate my hourly rate.

			<h6><a name="python3000">The Direction of Python 3000</a><br>3:30am Jan 28th, 2007</h6>
			<p>I am learning Python.  I have been on a scripting language learning kick for about a year now.  I have spent a good amount of time 
			learning Python and Ruby.  My focus has been on learning more about their metaprogramming capabilities.</p>
			<p>Guido (the creator of Python, also referred to as "the Benevolent Dictator for Life") is in the midst of working on Python 3000, 
			a non-backward compatible break from previous versions of Python.  Over at 
			Lambda the Ultimate, their is an <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/587">article</a> that talks about Guido's intended 
			removal of some of the functional aspects of Python, specifically in this case, referring to the removal of reduce() from the language.  
			I personally feel that leaving these constructs in is vital to the life of Python, even though I have only been working in the language 
			for a couple of months.  With these functional constructs you invite the use of higher order functions when they are appropriate.  
			Without them, the first things everyone is going to write in their Python libraries are: map, reduce, filter, remove-if, and sort 
			(Note: I am borrowing some names from Lisp here).  Wouldn't we rather have built in support for these constructs?  
			These constructs would be more powerful if lambda was extended to be more than a single line, 
			and allowed for the use of things other than pure expressions.  I know this type of extension is possible in Python-like syntax because Boo
			provides a multiline lambda equivalent (called "do").</p>
			<p>Really, this redesign is only a problem because new constructs cannot be created in Python.  You cannot extend the langauge 
			itself, as easily as you can in Lisp/Scheme.  With no macro support Python is simply not as easy to extend as Lisp/Scheme.
			Shouldn't it be a clue that the extensible nature of a language is lacking if people are fighting over what is in or out of a language 
			in the next version?  It's unlikely you would hear a fight about this in any thread on Lisp because anyone with some time on their 
			hands can easily implement the higher order constructs through macros.  Again, I know this sort of syntactic macro support is 
			possible because Boo provides it.  </p>
			<p>Some of these functions can be replaced by the use of list comprehensions.  It may be the case that I am 
			simply complaining because I want different ways to do the same thing; something that is 
			common in the Ruby culture, but not in the Python culture.  I believe the functional methods that are currently part of Python 
			are part of what makes Python so flexible and beautiful.  Removing functionality for the sake of "ease of use" or homogeninity is 
			useful when programming for end users, not when you are programming for the ultimate in power users: programmers themselves.</p>
			
			<h6><a name="learning-new-languages-through-contracting">Learning New Languages Through Contracting</a><br>2:49am Jan 28th, 2007</h6>
			<p>I'm a contractor more and more, so I take a different approach to learning new programming languages.  I evaluate a technology not 
			only based on its technical factors, but on how much money I can make with it.  That means taking into account how many other people 
			are using it, what the pay rate 
			for that technology is, and the amount of jobs in that technology.  As a contractor I have the advantage of seeing lots and lots of jobs, 
			which can help to give me a better overview of what types of jobs are available out there.  I am in the midst of categorizing common 
			types of programming that are called for in small contracts (in my case, on Guru.com).  
			</p>

			<p>Once I identify an existing / emerging market for a particular piece of software, I try to narrow down the technologies used for that market.  
			An example: lots of people seemingly need web spiders, usually for specific websites and types of information.  Normally, these people are 
			using Windows, and also don't care what language you write it in, as long as they get what they want.  
			</p>

			<p>This is the perfect market for you to learn a new scripting language in.  Ruby, Perl, Python, Boo* or [insert scripting language you are curious 
			about] are all welcome here as long as you can get them to run on Windows.  If you have no experience in the language you have decided 
			to target (almost a personal taste choice) then try to get one of these jobs, and make it a small one.  Don't worry as much about money 
			for the first job, just get some experience.  If you pull it off, you get a good reference and experience in that language with that problem space.  
			The next job will make you money because you have experience in both the problem space and the language (not to mention the 
			possibility of existing code).  
			</p>

			<p>In this way, I try to let the market determine what the next thing I learn is going to be.  If I find a market that has a lot of opportunity, I want 
			to try to dominate that market, almost to the point where I am selling a customizable stand-alone solution, even though the jobs might vary somewhat 
			(think producing your own domain specific language for that problem space in your target language).  In our example, this would be writing a DSL 
			to support the acquiring, searching and cataloging of web page information (links, phone numbers, addresses, names, domains, files, file types, etc.).  
			</p>

			<p>This technique has the added side effect of making your contracting jobs more profitable as you do more of them.  </p>

			<p>Also, don't be afraid to learn something new.  Spending the time to learn something new isn't ever a waste in my opinion.  Reviewing alternative 
			languages is always helpful because it can give you a better perspective on your favorite languages.  Learning new programming techniques always 
			increases your general knowledgebase, allowing you to make more educated decisions for your customer.  Learning something new shouldn't even be 
			thought of as a chore.  
			</p>

			<h6><a name="simplicity-vs-complexity-vs-a-3rd-option">Simplicity vs. Complexity vs. A 3rd Option?<br>6:41pm Jan 9th, 2007</h6>
			<p>First, read the <a href="http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/simplicity_is_highly.html">Donald Norman</a>, 
			<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/09.html">Joel Spolsky</a> and 
			<a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/fortune_favors_big_turds.html">Zed Shaw</a> 
			articles that discuss this topic.</p>
			<p>Ok, welcome back.  As Zed correctly pointed out it isn't Simplicty vs. Complexity.  It's something else.  
			He alludes to it being something that is a simple set of rules or actions that when combined together
			create a flexible and powerful system for the user.  I am going avoid pointing out that Lisp has but seven core 
		 	functions and from those develops into a powerful (some say most powerful) programming language.  Long story 
		 	short, Zed's right, but he doesn't come out and say it.  
			</p>
			<p>You see, the issue is that you have to create something that is *simple* to use, but that is capable of *complex* 
			interactions.  I would argue that most of the successful end-user software in the world falls into this category.  Excel, 
			for example, is very simple to use compared to its expressive power.  Word is simple to use assuming you are doing something
			straightforward, but it doesn't prevent you from using more complex and powerful functions if you need them.  Outlook is 
			simple to use once you have it setup (that's what we have IT people for, right?).  Want your email? Click the button.  Want to 
			write an email, click "new" and start typing.  Want to create an appointment on your calendar?  Double click on the day.  
			These are all simple acts that yield powerful results. 
			</p>
			<p>Humans, in their infinite wisdom, are very good at overusing an undercapable piece of software (my evidence for this is 
			Excel itself, I've seen people effectively implement relational database mechanisms in Excel, and they weren't programmers).  
			37Signals has figured this out.  They don't need to provide capabilities for every possible situation, they just have to 
			provide basic, general constructs and then let the user shoehorn their use into those general constructs.  You can use a 
			blank textbox with no validation for a lot of things.  Need to make an appointment?  Type the time and date.  Need to make a 
			list?  Just type in the numbers as you go.  Need to save a little bit of information (a URL, phone #, or address)?  Just type it in.  			
			</p>
			<p>Google's search engine is possible the most blatant example of this.  Incredibly easy to use, ridiculously powerful when 
			given complexity by the user.  Think about what you can find on Google: Movies time, the actual time, directions, companies, 
			information about plants, girlfriends, boyfriends, old school mates, yourself, banking information, cultural information, a 
			picture of your house from space, and seemingly unending ads about what you are looking for.  Every person who can type 
			can use Google.  It provides a really simple interface and really complex power.
			</p>
			<p>Humans really only use software, particularly business software for a couple of basic functions.  Sometimes, there are 
			specific functions that are required (think accounting software), but often times people are using what is available to 
			implement their own specific process.  Make it simple to use by providing the basic constructs, and let the user put in 
			whatever additional complexity they need.  That way your software is *simple* and *complex* at the same time.

			<h6><a name="Parallel-programming">Why Parallel Programming and Multicore Chips Won't Change How We Program as Much as Advertised</a>
				<br>3:02am Jan 6th, 2007</h6>
			<p>I know, everyone thinks that parallel programming and multicore chips are the future of programming.  I know, 
			what I am writing probably amounts to a reasonable level of heresy at this point.  But guess what?  Users don't care 
			about parallel processing anymore than they care about how RAM works or what a hash table is.  They care about 
			getting their work done.  
			</p>
			<p>How do they work?  They work at business machines.  They work on single tasks.  They work 
			in systems that are backed by large central databases stored on large servers in another room.  The only time they 
			are waiting is when the program is retrieving information from the database.  The slowest part of that is the database 
			retrieval itself.  That's not happening on our users new multicore processor.  The database processing has long been 
			happening on multicore systems, which admittedly will see a boost in effective speed, but they are already written to be 
			parallel.  The results from the server are then 
			transmitted to the user's computer and are instantly displayed.  This is even true of C# systems, which have another 
			layer on top of the operating system (as opposed to C/C++).  The bottleneck of speed is not on the user's computer 
			in the case of using a desktop application for work.  How about a web application?  Even with Internet Explorer bloat 
			the computer is quite capable of rendering the web page very quickly once it has the data to render.  The web 
			application user still has the same database bottleneck, and might also have a bandwidth bottleneck as well (in the 
			case of movie viewing or other large file download).  
			</p>
			<p>All of this leads to me ask: what is the user getting out of multicore processors and our rush to make parallelizable 
			programs mainstream?  Business users get effectively nothing.  The two resources they are most interested in are 
			either a database or information off the internet, neither of which are slowed by the processing power of the 
			computer at this point.  Non-business users do gain an edge in various forms of game code processing.  I can imagine 
			that rendering engines, and physics engines get a massive boost in productivity from multiple cores.  That means game 
			programmers are indeed going to be on the forefront of parallelization and parallel capable languages.  I also think the 
			average user will get something out of multicore processors, and largely that is the ability to listen to music without 
			interrupting their other programs.  Users will get some functional boost 
			because they are using multiple programs at once, not because they are using a single program that is written to take 
			advantage of a multicore processor.  
			</p>
			<p>Does this mean that we need to spend a lot of time rewritting every business 
			application in whatever new parallel language that comes along?  I doubt it.  Who are we helping with all this 
			clamour about new parallel processing capabilities and how we need new languages to handle the change over?  Maybe 
			it's us.  We're tired of doing everything in a single processor, especially if we have multiple threads.  We know that we 
			might be able to get things to compile faster, reducing our wait time.  It certainly isn't for the users of business software.

			<h6>More on Consulting through Guru.com<br>4:20am Jan 4th, 2007</h6>
			<p>I really enjoy contracting work.  It might not be for everybody, but it is surely for me.  
			I like getting to do something different everyday if I want to.  I like the pursuit of work, 
			the feeling of glee when you get the job and then the feeling of completion when you are done.  
			</p>
			<p>Most people don't like to consult the way that I do.  I spend most of my time working on jobs I found through
			<a href="http://guru.com">Guru.com</a>.  I have been selected for five jobs through the site, at an average of $721 
			per job. [Note: these numbers do not reflect jobs that were completed outside of the Guru system, nor do they count 
			the job that I am receiving equity in a company for completing.] In the last round of bidding I did, I bid on 7 jobs, 
			and have received responses (the first step to being awarded 
			the job) from 4 of them.  In the past, this number has hovered around 1 response for every 10-11 jobs that I bid.  I am not sure
			if these most recent numbers are an abberration, or if they represent the beginning of a trend of improved bid success.  Either 
			way, it is possible to make a decent living working through Guru.com.  It appears to snowball to some extent, allowing you 
			to bid larger and larger jobs with a higher and higher bid acceptance rate.  
			</p>
			<p>There seems to be a commonly held feeling that it is not possible for a U.S. based programmer (or company) to make a decent living
			from sites similar to Guru.com, mostly due to the global competition from programmers working in countries with a dollar exchange advantage.  
			While I admit there are lots of jobs that fly under my minimum bid amount, I don't believe that there is as high a preference for "cheap" labor 
			as is generally assumed, particularly if that cheaper labor doesn't speak and write clear English.  I also cannot understate the impact 
			of being dependable.  Some customers will pay double the amount to a programmer that is dependable that they might with an 
			unknown quantity.  For that reason it is vitally important that I provide clear, concise, and repeated information to my customers, 
			as soon as that information is available.
			</p>
			<p>Lastly, it appears there is a serious talent drain occuring in the IT industry.  Anecdotal evidence appears to bear this out.  
			Everything from interviewers reporting that the candidates are woefully underskilled, to large companies complaining about the 
			rates that they are having to pay programmers.  This only helps someone who is working on small to midrange contracts through 
			the online contracting websites.  As more and more programmers are swallowed in corporate america, small companies have less and less
			option when they need a quick program written.  Increased demand leads to increased prices, even with respect to a global market.  It 
			is for this reason that I am not particularly concerned about getting more work.  The work is there, you just have to provide good 
			customer service.  Your customers will thank you for it, and they'll be willing to pay you more too. 
			</p>

			<p>Reproduced below is a post that I made to <a href="http://Joelonsoftware.com">Joel On Software</a> 
			in the Business of Software section.  Several people expressed a great deal of interest in this topic and 
			seemed to appreciate the post, so I thought I would repost it here as well.  Further discussion on the topic 
			of online contracting (using a web site to find most of your contracting work) will follow.
			-- Joshua Volz, Volz Software</p>
			
			<p><img src="img/ldquo.png"/>I have only really been working on Guru.com for about a month, so YMMV on all tactics 
			in this post.</p>
			<p>
			What is the first question: why Guru?  I picked Guru because they seem to have a good 
			amount of ongoing jobs and a good job add rate.  Additionally, and maybe even more 
			important, you pay to bid jobs through Guru and it's not entirely what I would call cheap.  
			Some places don't seem to take money up front, but take a percentage when you do a job 
			through them.  I wanted to look more professional and more serious, so I went with a site 
			where I had to pay to bid as a "vendor."  I feel this gives the impression of it really being 
			a business, instead of some kid in his mother's basement.  It seems to keep out the riff-
			raff and it sets a minimum cost of doing business precedent.  If you are bidding against 
			kids and professionals from countries that use another currency (giving them the price 
			advantage) you are at a serious disadvantage.  If the customer wants a professional, and 
			they know you paid to have the opportunity to bid their job, they are going to be more 
			accepting of slightly higher prices, especially per hour.
			</p>
			<p>
			There are plenty of .NET website projects on Guru.  I would say there are even more 
			PHP jobs, and occasionally finding something for Python, Perl or Ruby (in terms of web 
			work).  It's important to note that a lot of the people posting don't care what technology 
			you use as long as you provide a *solution* to their problem.  I haven't done any web 
			work (I am mostly doing C# Winforms type stuff) so I can't really speak to that market's 
			specifics.  
			</p>
			<p>
			So far, I have been awarded three smaller sized jobs through Guru.com.  <br>
			- A C# Winforms cleanup job for $265.  <br>
			- A python web scrapping program for $198. <br>  
			- A C# Winforms job as a companion for a pretty wild project (I cannot go into this at 
			this point) for $900.  <br>
			</p>
			<p>
			Admittedly, these aren't huge numbers.  But, given that I was working until recently with 
			zero references I feel like it's decent.  I have already been called back by the first job to 
			do another job for $250.  I have a big C# Winforms job that I am awaiting approval on 
			that I found through Guru.com ($14,600).  I met someone through Guru.com that I am 
			now going to partner up with on a project (for 50% equity, I do the programming and 
			technical stuff).  Finally, I have another job that is in a holding pattern, but I have spoken 
			to the customer and they seem to want to go with me ($1800).  
			</p>
			<p>
			At this point, I am using Guru.com to augment my "in-person" contracting gigs.  For that 
			purpose, I find it is very useful.  If you have an afternoon off, and you want to try to 
			make a quick $150-200, you can probably do so.  
			</p>
			<p>
			From a marketing perspective I try to answer all the questions that I would have as a 
			customer.  A good starter list of questions to answer:
			</p>
			<p>
			1. Can you do it?  (References, experience in the particular problem space, etc.)
			</p>
			<p>
			2. How long will it take? 
			</p>
			<p>
			3. How much will it cost?  How do we pay you?  Escrow services, invoices, payment 
			schedules, et al should be clearly spelled out. <br>
			[2, 3 are amply discussed everywhere, I am not going to even try to squeeze their 
			discussion in here.]
			</p>
			<p>
			4. Can we trust you? (NDAs, escrow through guru.com, references, etc.)
			</p>
			<p>
			5. When are you available?  Are you doing this as a side gig to your day job, or are you a 
			full-time contractor?
			</p>
			<p>
			6. ***Important*** How well do you communicate?  Can you speak the language they 
			speak fluently?  Can they call you on the phone (I have found some people just feel better 
			about working with you once they have spoken to you on the phone)?  Do you answer 
			emails quickly?  Do you keep them informed on what is going on with the project?  Do 
			you tell them how the project will work beforehand (meaning, your development plan - 
			I'll get into this later)?
			</p>
			<p>
			7. Where are you located?  Are you close to their office?  Can you meet them face to 
			face?  Will you be in the area later on?  I mention that I am US based provider as some 
			customers seem to have a preference for that.
			</p>
			<p>
			8. Any questions they have specifically put in the bid.  Answer them all to the best of 
			your ability.  
			</p>
			<p>
			9. What technology are you going to use to solve their problem and why?  Sometimes I 
			feel like a Windows and .NET platform salesman.  Having a strong grasp of what 
			technologies are good for what problem types is invaluable here.  For example, I had a 
			client that had to have a script that would run on FreeBSD and Windows.  Python turned 
			out to be my winner there, even though I am largely a C# (and lately Boo) centric shop.  
			If you are doing a website for someone, PHP is probably your best bet, unless they 
			specifically mention Django or Rails.  
			</p>
			<p>
			10. What makes you different?  Why should we pick you?  Try to interject some 
			personality into your website and a little into your bids.  They are hiring a person and 
			they want to know that person is going to be good to work with (I guess this goes back to 
			communication).  
			</p>
			<p>
			11. [Sometimes, optional] Explanations about how the Guru process works.  What step 
			do they have to take?  What happens next if they pick you?  Often, customers are new to 
			the Guru system.  Helping them acclimate ups your chances of them liking you and your 
			bid.
			</p>
			<p>
			Strategy:
			</p>
			<p>
			My strategy is to answer as many of these questions as I can in the bid.  I have a template 
			that I fill in with the specifics of the job.  I cannot overstate the usefulness of Direct 
			Access (http://nagarsoft.com) during the bid writing process for text replacements.  
			Sometimes you can get a feel from the job post what kind of amount the poster is looking 
			to spend.  Try to be close to that number.  If you aren't, you aren't likely to get the job.  I 
			wouldn't do anything huge for a small amount (you have to make money or you won't 
			stay in business), but some flexibility is necessary when competing with other contractors 
			that live in countries with other currencies.
			</p>
			<p>
			Since I started with zero references on Guru, I felt it was important to have a plan to build 
			up a client body quickly.  My plan was to underbid small projects in order to get 
			references.  If you underbid a small project, you aren't losing that much money (since it's 
			small), but you still get a reference, presumably that is good, and a happy customer since 
			they got a quality job for cheap.  Those customers seem to come back.  This strategy is 
			betting that sometime down the road that customer is going to need something big.  The 
			big jobs are where you make your money.  Having established yourself with the customer 
			as fair, competent and all around good they will accept your bid and explanation for the 
			larger project (a.k.a. yes, it is more, and here is why...").  
			</p>
			<p>
			When you have no references, you have a credibility problem.  The way I tried to work 
			around it (and it appeared to work) was to build credibility in other areas.  You should 
			have a solid website that talks about your contracting business, your experience, shows 
			examples, and testimonials if you have any from previous customers.  With every bid, I 
			send screen shot examples of my previous work, particularly if I have a screen shot of a 
			program similar to the job.  As soon as I got my first reference, I made sure to put a quote 
			from him in every bid.  I mentioned that he was happy with my work, and that he had 
			endorsed me through Guru.  Endorsement appears to be a higher level of praise than 
			merely saying you did a good job.  
			</p>
			<p>
			On Guru there is a ranking system.  The system is based on customer feedback and the 
			amount of money you have earned (total and in the past year, I believe).  Obviously, 
			doing more projects for more money is going to give you an advantage in rating.  As soon 
			as I start breaking the top 100 (I think there are ~1800 contractors in my subsection of 
			programming) I am likely going to start mentioning that in my bids and putting that 
			number on my website.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Communication is another way to set you apart from your competition.  Clearly written 
			English and availability (via phone, fax, email, IM, carrier pigeon, telepathy) are 
			important in the bidding process.  They shouldn't ever wonder "how can I get a hold of 
			this guy?"  My templates for bidding are largely based on the suggested templates from 
			Guru.  The Guru people aren't new to this process and they have put together a pretty 
			comprehensive list of examples to help you develop your working documents (bids, 
			proposals, time tables, etc.).  
			</p>
			<p>
			Your development plan can set you apart.  If you lay out what you are going to do for the 
			customer, and how you are going to go about providing them a solution, then you are 
			setting the stage for a successful project.  In my case, I use an iterative approach.  I 
			explain that basically I will code, they will approve and suggest changes, repeatedly until 
			they are happy.  They seem to like this because they get feedback often (and it shows 
			signs of progress) and it's open ended enough that they feel like they are going to get 
			what they want.  I am finding that they are even a little open ended on the length of the 
			project if you explain that this is how you work, and that you have had lots of success 
			working this way in the past.  Most business people know that quality takes time.  If you 
			tell them that you are going to keep working on it until they are happy, then when they 
			first look at the prototype and it's not perfect yet, they don't panic.  You told them it 
			wouldn't be perfect and that you were going to fix it as soon as they told you how to 
			make it perfect.  [Side note: I have found this works really well with women customers.  
			They seem to respond well to getting what they want, having the option to change their 
			mind, and being listened to.  I suppose that might be a human thing, but in my experience 
			so far it has worked exceedingly well with women.]
			</p>
			<p>
			Final Note:
			</p>
			<p>
			Always provide a solution.  You aren't a programmer anymore.  Now you fix problems.  
			If the problem requires that you whip up a quick spreadsheet for the customer, do it.  If it 
			requires you download new software, test it out, call companies to get quotes, do it.  If it 
			requires you learning a new platform or skill, do it.  If it means going to Fry's and buying 
			another ethernet cable and a NIC card and putting it in a computer, do it.  If it means 
			finding someone else who knows how to do something really specific that they need, do 
			it.  If it requires changing paper in their printer because they are having a horrible day and 
			the printer being out of paper almost brings them to tears, for God's sake do it.  [Note: I 
			didn't make this story up, it happened to me today.]  If the toilet is backed up, call your 
			uncle the plumber and get him to do it.  If you simply cannot do whatever they need 
			(maybe it requires a license or something) find someone to do it.  Long story short, do it.  
			Get them a solution, technological or otherwise as soon as possible.  If you can't get them 
			a full solution for a while, get them a partial one immediately that you can later convert to 
			a full solution.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Sorry this was so long.  I might repost this with alterations on my blog.  If anyone has 
			questions, feel free to post, I'll be checking back, or email me directly.  <img src="img/rdquo.png"/>

			<h6><a name="bidding-against-foreign-nationals">Bidding Against Foreign Nationals</a><br>12:22am Oct 31st, 2006</h6>
			<p>I read an interesting article calling for the boycotting of programming outsourcing webistes, such as elance.com and RentACoder(RAC).
			The original article can be found here: </p><p><a href="http://irfanhabib.wordpress.com/2006/10/30/why-developers-should-boycott-online-outsourcing-services/">
			<i>Why Developers Should Boycott Online Outsourcing Services</i></a> </p>
			<p>I think this topic merits some discussion, but more importantly merits some thought on how programmers from the US should react to these relatively 
			new market conditions.</p>
			<p>
			I have recently started working from some of these websites.  There does seem to be an unrealistic expectation in terms of the price of 
			software development.  And, it is important to note that the price of software development is different to the price of software.  Software 
			is resold many times over, allowing the development costs to be spread over many sales.  This means that software can be sold for less than 
			the cost of developing it.  
			</p>
			<p>
			If you are an employer that is trying to pay someone to develop software directly for you, that software only has one possible customer, you.  
			Therefore, economically, it should cost more than any software that has more potential customers.  Nobody posting jobs on these outsourcing sites 
			seems to understand that.  Factor in the percentage that the job site takes, and you get a situation where it is not reasonable for US based programmers 
			to develop custom 
			software for a single client, especially when you start comparing it to having a day job.
			</p>
			<p>
			The programmers from countries that have lower costs of living, lower living standards, and where dollars have more buying power, obviously have an 
			advantage in bidding against American contractors.  American contractors have to provide better service and better quality to overcome the natural 
			price advantage that programmers from other countries have.  Strong written and verbal english skills are a good place to start.  Customer service is 
			another potential differentiator.  Being in the same time zone can also help matters.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I think these sites do have their place in American contractor businesses though.  They are good places to get new recurring customers.  If you do a 
			good job with your first project, then it can lead to larger (and more profitable) future projects.  One strategy would be to do very small (less than 1 day) 
			projects for very cheap, on par with the non-American programmers.  Smaller projects are better because you aren't losing as much money compared to 
			doing a larger project at the non-American rates.  Think of it as a loss-leader project.  Assuming you do a good job, you have established a relationship 
			with the customer.  They know you are going to do a good job, so they enlist your help in the future with other projects.  Ideally, those projects will be 
			larger and because of your relationship with the customer you represent less of a risk (they know you are going to do good work) and provide other 
			non-price related benefits (english, time zone, etc.), you are therefore worth more money.  
			</p>
			<p>Establishing the relationship also means that you can deal with the customer directly, effectively removing the need to pay the outsourcing site.  
			According to the article that inspired this post, that can be up to 20%.  A 20% raise is nothing to scoff at.   
			</p>
			<p>A problem with this approach is that your customer will continue to expect cut-throat hourly rates in future projects.  By doing smaller projects for 
			lower rates, the customer has the expectation that you are giving them an extremely low rate.  With larger projects, they assume that same rate is in effect 
			but that the project is so much larger that your quote has now reached reasonable livable wage.  If your customer is resistant to this idea, you simply 
			explain that the project is much larger, justifying the larger quote.  If you have done a good job on your smaller projects, then your customer is much less 
			likely to take the risk on using someone other than you, even if they can get the same project for cheaper from an outsourcing website.  You also 
			benefit from already knowing the customers' business, all the key employees, and the previous code you have already written for them.  Providing that you do not 
			make your quote too far outside the comfort zone for your customer, they are going to use you.  
			</p>
			<p>Another alternative is to specialize in a particular market segment that foreigners would have trouble learning without being present at the company.  
			Domain specific knowledge makes you more valuable no matter whether you are competing with foreign labor or not.  By focusing your efforts in a particular 
			area, you can also become more efficient in that area.  Your specialization makes it easier to do certain projects, and for those projects you can come down 
			on your price to the point where the other benefits your provide outweigh the difference in price.  
			</p>
			<p>American programmers (and, frankly, American companies and American labor in all economic sectors) need to start operating like they are competing 
			with everyone in the world, instead of just everyone in the US.  The natural advantage that US programmers have is that they are in the US.  We 
			have less cultural barriers to overcome, have a better command of the language of the client (presumably, English).  By using and emphasizing these natural 
			advantages US programmers can continue to profit in the custom software industry.
			</p>
			
			<h6><a name="dont-make-me-think">"Don't Make Me Think" and Being Behind the Times</a><br>6:49pm oct 26th, 2006</h6>
			<p>So, this web thing is starting to really catch on.  It has a cool name ("Web 2.0") and people are making literally 
			billions of dollars when they sell their companies.  Apparently, while I was in a cave in post bubble busting depression, the web recovered 
			its footing.  While I was slaving away on C# Windows desktop applications, people were writing new browsers (or is that reusing old ones?). 
			They were making sure cascading style sheets actually (well, ok, sorta) worked.  People were writing CMS frameworks and adopting Python 
			and Ruby as the latest incarnations of "let's get it done fast" and then building frameworks on top of them with the overarching "let's get it 
			done fast" burned in.
			</p>
			<p>While you were all fighting with browser compatability, javascript (which, incidentally, appears to be a decent language, despite its 
			inclusion in web browsers), DHTML, AJAX and the latest social networking sites I was digging into corporate networks, writing management 
			reports and typing "public void" way too many times.  Long story short, I am behind.  I have stunted the growth of my professional career 
			without even realizing it, by not taking a job doing web programming 5 years ago.  
			</p>
			<p>I admit it.  The web doesn't excite me.  Yes, you can get it from everywhere.  Yes you don't have to install the software on the computer 
			and yes, it's the quickest way to get to be a billionaire that requires less than $5,000 startup capital (and endless nights of staring into a computer 
			monitor).  It just doesn't excite me.  I am not sure why.  I think it might have something to do with the idea that the browser has become just 
			another platform to me.  Now, instead of using Java (I am pretending here that "write once, run anywhere" is actually real) I can write an 
			application, test it on both IE and FireFox and suddenly I am cross platform (I am ignoring Safari and Opera - send me hate mail if you must).  
			Interestingly, this brand of cross platform requires the mastery of at least 4 distinct languages or domain specific languages (Javascript, 
			SQL, CSS, HTML, probably XML and whatever you write your web app in).  Honesty, if someone came to you and said, "okay, we can get your 
			app everywhere and there's no installation on your customers' computers, but you have to write it in 6 languages, two of which use angle brackets, 
			and two of which use curly braces" would you think "sweet that sounds like the future of programming?"
			</p>
			<p>I give up.  You win.  </p>			
			<p>Let the healing begin.  I started by making a couple of websites.  First this one.  Yeah, I know, stunning isn't it?  Then I made one for a product 
			that I put out, called <a href="http://llamacarboncopy.com">Llama Carbon Copy</a>.  The first version of that site was horrible.  I let people tear it 
			apart on a public forum so that I could get some good ideas.  In the end, it took me two weeks, but the site is looking much better than it did before 
			I started working on it.  In that time, I realized that I am not paying enough attention to the design details of things that I make.  From one poster I got 
			an semi-solicited mockup of my program, only with all the things he would change just to make it look better.  <a href="img/fix-the-ui.jpg">
			<img src="img/fix-the-ui.jpg" style="Float:Left; width:150px; height:125px;padding: 3px; border:none;"/> </a>To be fair, 
			the guy is right.  I realized he was right as I was reading his email to me.  I tried to hire him to tell me what I was doing wrong in other places.  This guy had 
			already spent probably 20-30 minutes straightening out my design flaws, without the thought of reward.  I figured he would at least accept some kind of 
			compensated role in that capacity.  I got a resounding "No".  He said he was too busy to help me.
			</p>
			<p>Left alone again, I turn to my backup plan: read.  I headed out to Border's and acquired "Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug.  It took me a couple of 
			evenings to read and absorb.  This book is excellent for putting you in the state of mind to do great design.  Not only does he point out specific ways to 
			improve a website, he gives you general ideals to guide you when you enter unfamiliar territory.  I highly recommend it.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, now I am forced to do something about my previous ignorance.  Now, I am forced to rework the look and feel of my product.  Now, I 
			am forced to rework the websites I have up.  Now, I am forced to learn about web programming.</p>
			
			<p>The only advantage I have is that I have spent the last six months learning Ruby in my spare time.  Not Ruby on Rails mind you, just normal everyday 
			desktop Ruby.  Border's again comes to the rescue.  Armed with my two Ruby on Rails books, I am going to start to learn about this mysterious and 
			scary world that is web application programming.

			I recently stumbled onto a very interesting website.  Someone calling themself the "Software Jedi" decided 
			it would be an interesting exercise to write 30 small applications in 30 days.  This feat in itself is worth reading 
			about:			
			</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.anappaday.com/downloads/">http://www.anappaday.com/downloads/</a></p>
			<p>Some of these small applications are pretty cool.  I am particularly fond of two of them: 
			<a href="http://www.anappaday.com/downloads/2006/10/day-22-jedi-window-dock.html">Jedi Window Dock (JWD)</a>
			and 
			<a href="http://www.anappaday.com/downloads/2006_09_01_anappadaydownloads_archive.html">Jedi Concentrate</a>
			(Search for "Jedi Concentrate").  Concentrate dims all but the focused window in an attempt to help you concentrate 
			on that particular window.  Excellent if you are trying to avoid email or IM notificatons.  Jedi Window Dock is my 
			favorite though.  The concept is to allow you to dock multiple application windows in a single tabbed browsing environment.  
			</p>
			<p>This has two central affects.  First, it allows you to group applications (or instances of applications) that are related 
			into a single environment.  This can be helpful if you need to have your IDE, your source control program, two web browsers 
			showing the results of the code you are writing, and a testing application open all at once.  This collecting of related 
			programs allows for an easy, single click environment to work on a particular project.  The second effect is that it 
			gets rid of the clutter in your taskbar.  Anything that gets rid of clutter there is a big win in my book.  
			</p>
			<p>I am right now using the JWD to collect together several instances of Notepad2 (which doesn't offer 
			internal tabbed browsing) that all hold files related to HippoFondue.com.  The JWD gives every program the chance to have 
			tabbed browsing.  What more can you want from an application that was created in less than four hours?

			<h6><a name="report-architecture">Report architecture done; just need cross tab support</a><br>6:00pm Oct 10th, 2006  </h6>
			<p>Alright, so it took me nearly all of yesterday (as in, 12 hours from 2pm when I woke up to 2am when I stopped working) 
			to get the program so that it would work how I wanted it to.  I am pleased with the outcome.  I had to get a bit nasty with 
			some anonymous methods and generics in order to do what I wanted, but in the end it worked out.  
			</p>
			<p>Also, I just want to throw out there that I am impressed with Microsoft SQL Server Management Express.  It's got a 
			horribly long name for something that is pretty good at what it does.  It is sort of a combination of Query Analyzer and 
			Enterprise Manager.  If you haven't used it yet, and you are using SQL Server 2005 (even Express) you should give it a try.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Alright, so the goal was to make a reasonable working reporting engine.  Mostly, this involves the creation of some 
			simple things that when combined together make up a report.  The header, footer, and scoping information are all straight forward.  
			The data output is also relatively straight forward.  In my case this meant looping through the data table rows and returning a 
			string that matched the format that I was trying to produce (either a pipe delimited text file, or an html file).  
			</p>
			<p>The first challenge comes in when you have to total some of the columns.  In my case, those columns happened to be money values 
			and were internally represented as doubles.  However, I didn't want to have to write frameworks for every type of column (string, double, int, DateTime, etc.).  
			I was hoping to get away with writing 1 accumulator that was flexible enough that I could mutate it on instantiation to do what I wanted.  My targets 
			were counting accumulators and summing accumulators.  Those are the most common accumulation types in the reports I was making.  In Ruby, this sort of 
			thing can be accomplished very easily because Ruby has real closures, first class functions, and duck typing.  As it turns out, you can fake more of that 
			in C# than I thought.  Here's a class:
			</p>
			<p class="code">
				<span class="keyword">public </span><span class="keyword">class </span>Accumulator< T > {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">protected </span>T _it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">protected </span>AccumulatorDelegate _d;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">public </span>delegate T AccumulatorDelegate(T val, T it);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">public </span>Accumulator(AccumulatorDelegate d) { _d = d; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">public </span>Accumulator(T init, AccumulatorDelegate d) : this(d) { _it = init; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">public </span>T Accumulation {<span class="keyword">get{</span>	 <span class="keyword">return </span>_it; } }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">public </span>T Accumulate(T datum) { <span class="keyword">return </span>_it = _d(datum, _it); }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">public </span><span class="keyword">override </span><span class="keyword">string </span>ToString() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">if(</span>	_it != null) <span class="keyword">return </span>_it.ToString();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">return </span>"";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}
			</p>
			<p>Now, you are looking at that and saying to yourself "wtf?"  Am I right?  Yeah, me too.  I wanted a class that would allow me to use it for any type.  
			The generics handle that pretty well.  It does seem to give you a level of flexibility that I am only used to getting in Ruby or Scheme.  Personally, I was 
			more interested in passing an anonymous function to the object on instantiation that would do the accumulation for that object.  This gives you a lot 
			of flexibility with the object you are creating.  I had the constructor take a two argument delegate so that the delegate could be passed the internal 
			value of the accumulation "_it".  Otherwise there is no way to refer to that value when you are defining your anonymous method.  It's a kludge, I agree, but 
			it worked for me in this relatively simple case.  So, there you have it, I am instantiating an object with any type, and passing it a delegate that works on that 
			type, effectively making the object a closure in a very loose sense of the word.  
			</p>
			<p>You can create an accumulator by doing something similar to the following:</p>
			<p class="code">
Accumulator<double> sum = <span class="keyword">new </span>Accumulator<double>(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">delegate(</span>	<span class="keyword">double </span>x, <span class="keyword">double </span>it) { <span class="keyword">return </span>it += x; })<br>
Accumulator<double> max = <span class="keyword">new </span>Accumulator<double>(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">delegate(</span>	<span class="keyword">double </span>x, <span class="keyword">double </span>it) {<span class="keyword">if(</span>	 it < x ) <span class="keyword">return </span>x; else <span class="keyword">return </span>it;})
			</p>
			<p>The final thing that is interesting is the implementation of the ToString().  It basically calls the ToString() of the _it internal variable.  But, what this 
			does is allows you to put the accumulator object (actually, many of them) into a Hashtable or ArrayList, and then when you get it back you don't have 
			to cast it to a specific type of accumulator, you just call the ToString() and it gives you the information you want.  In my case, I needed a string representation 
			of everything, so I can just use the ToString().  This is especially useful when you have to accumulate values from columns of different types. </p>

			<h6><a name="report-gui">Report GUI done</a><br>1:10pm Oct 6th, 2006</h6>
			<p>The report GUI was easy for two reasons.  First, I have my own library of controls that fit into my architecture and work well 
			with my home grown code generation tool for making CRUD apps.  Second, for this incarnation of the reporting engine we are not having dynamic 
			scope controls based on the report.  With fixed inputs, things become a lot easier.  Here's a screen shot:<br /><br />

			<h6><a name="insanity-of-roll-your-own">On reports, Excel and the insanity of roll your own</a><br>12:14pm Oct 6th, 2006</h6>
			<p>I am about to roll my own very simple reporting engine.  Why would I do that?  Because I don't have Crystal installed on this machine, 
			and my Empower application isn't approved.  Therefore, to make the reports that I need to show off next Tuesday I am going to roll my own.  Madness 
			you say?  We're going to find out.  
			</p>
			<p>I would only consider this because I need 5 reports.  The first two are very similar, and the remaining three all have the same layout.  Therefore, 
			it is conceivably possible to write a very, very simple layout mechanism over the weekend.  I am doing that in addition to dumping the data to an 
			Excel spreadsheet, since that is what the office I am writing this for uses most of the time.  
			</p>
			<p>My intention is to use HTML to format the report.  Since everybody has a browser installed on their machine, it is easy to read for almost anyone who 
			needs to see it.  The rest of this project is in C#, so I am going to continue using it for this portion of the project.  
			</p>
			<p>As things proceed over the weekend, I will be posting screen shots and possibly some of the code.  I know you are all aghast with anticipation 
			like a giddy school girl opening Fight Club for the first time.</p>
